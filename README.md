**NAME OF PROJECT**

Hogwarts House Sorting Hat

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This application is my quarter 1 progress milestone. The objective is to demonstrate proficiency in vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, Bootstrap, and CSS. This required a great deal of refactoring and support from other devs.

**USER STORY**

The user (ostensibly a Harry Potter fan) can enter their name into the sorting form and a card will generate, randomly assigning the user to a Hogwarts House. The user also has the option to expel any naughty students to Voldyman's army. 

**FEATURES**

- Toggle Hide/Show Name Form
- Student card generator
- Random house assignment with matching card image of the house crest
- Delete/Expel button which reassigns the selected student to a different container ("Voldyman's Army")
- Navigation bar that allows the user to sort students by house
