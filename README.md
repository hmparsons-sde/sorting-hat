**USER STORY**

The user (ostensibly a Harry Potter fan) can enter their name into the sorting form and a card will generate, randomly assigning the user to a Hogwarts House. The user also has the option to expel any naughty students to Voldemort's army. 

**FEATURES**

- Toggle Hide/Show Name Form
- Student card generator
- Random house assignment with matching card image & card background color
- Delete/Expel button which reassigns the selected student to a different section ("Voldemort's Army")
- Navigation bar that allows the user to sort students by house
